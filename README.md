## Title of the Project
Remaining Useful Life Estimation Using Ensemble Learning Approach for L-ion Batteries in Automobiles


The project focuses on predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of NMC-LCO Lithium-Ion batteries using machine learning models and ensemble learning techniques. Data from 14 batteries with a nominal capacity of 2.8 Ah is analyzed, extracting features like voltage decline rate and charge time change. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models are trained, achieving accuracies of 90.3%, 92.5%, and 88.7% respectively. The ensemble model ENHPT combines these predictions, resulting in a 94.8% accuracy. Deep learning models like CNN and LSTM further enhance accuracy to 96.2% and 97.5%. Feature selection through backward regression and correlation analysis optimizes model performance. Visualization tools like scatter plots and line graphs illustrate actual vs predicted RUL values, validating the models' effectiveness. This comprehensive approach supports advanced battery management systems for electric vehicles and renewable energy applications.
## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
The precise evaluation of lithium-ion battery Remaining Useful Life (RUL) is crucial for optimizing performance and reliability in energy storage systems. This project focuses on predicting the RUL of NMC-LCO Lithium-Ion batteries using cycle data analysis. The dataset, sourced from the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute, contains information about 14 batteries with a nominal capacity of 2.8 Ah, subjected to CC-CV charging at C/2 discharge speeds under controlled conditions. Key features such as voltage decline rate, charge time change, and discharge duration are extracted to understand degradation patterns. Machine learning models including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are employed to predict RUL. Ensemble learning techniques like bagging, boosting, and stacking further enhance accuracy by combining predictions from individual models. The ENHPT framework achieves an accuracy of 94.8%, demonstrating the effectiveness of ensemble methods. Deep learning models like CNN and LSTM improve accuracy even further, achieving 96.2% and 97.5% respectively. This comprehensive approach supports advanced battery management systems for electric vehicles and renewable energy applications, enabling proactive maintenance and reducing operational costs. By integrating real-time sensor data and environmental factors, future research can refine these models for broader applicability and enhanced reliability.
